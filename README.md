# RulialSynchronyMatrix
This project seeks to harness sophisticated machine learning techniques for processing EEG and fMRI data, employing programmable magnetic field generators and transcranial ultrasonic stimulation. The initiative is designed to cultivate a shared cognitive domain, analogous to rulial space, through synchronized neural stimulation of participants.
